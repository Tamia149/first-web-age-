<h1> The Best Airlines to fly in First Class </h1>







 <p> Do you like to travel? Have you ever travelled outside the country? I have had the opportunity to fly to several 
	countries. Most people don't think much about flying unless you have sit on a plane for over seven hours.If you have only
	been in a domestic flight you are probably thinking thats has to be a very uncomfortable flight.Truth is international flights have 
	a little more legroom and are more comfortable than domestic flights.The planes are bigger and the food is a lot better.
	Keeping all that in mind ,if you are able and willing to pay more and by more I mean a lot more,You can travel in first class.As the name 
	states you really travel in style. </p>
<p>	I researched which airlines had the best first class amenities and I will review the top three.At number three is 
	Emirates,followed by Singapore Airlines and lastly Etihad Airways the carrier of the United Arab Emirates or UAE in short. </p>

<p>	Above is a picture if a first class suite in Emirates.Emirates is all about privacy.</p>
<p> The [first class] seat is a suite, with sliding doors that you can close and retire behind.
	Other luxurious perks include a minibar,an on-board shower and dressing area, amenities from Bulgari, and a glass of Dom PÃ©rignon 2004 with breakfast.
	Ticket prices for a suite in Emirates will set you you back over $ 26000 round trip depending on your destination.Most one way 
	tickets in first class cost north of $10k.As you can see these prices are not for the average person. </p>
